The issue was resolved by implementing stricter data handling and connection management within the app. The original write operations lacked robust error handling and did not verify successful data persistence.  The solution includes improved error handling using the `observe(.value)` method and explicitly checking for successful write confirmation in the `completion` block of the write operation.  Furthermore, careful attention was paid to managing the Firebase connection lifecycle, ensuring that the app remains reliably connected to the database. This approach significantly reduced the occurrence of data loss and improved the overall reliability of data persistence.

```swift
// BugSolution.swift
ref.setValue(data) { error, ref in
  if let error = error {
    // Handle error appropriately
    print("Error writing data: "
          + error.localizedDescription)
  } else {
    // Data successfully written
    print("Data written successfully!")
  }
}

ref.observe(.value) { snapshot in
  // Handle data changes
  if let value = snapshot.value as? [String: Any] {
     // Process data
  } else {
    // Handle nil data
  }
}
```
