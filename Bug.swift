In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't persisting to the Realtime Database despite successful writes.  The issue was intermittent, occurring seemingly at random. The code used standard Firebase methods for writing data, without any apparent errors being logged.  Debugging showed the data appearing briefly in the Firebase console, then vanishing. This occurred only on iOS devices, not Android.
